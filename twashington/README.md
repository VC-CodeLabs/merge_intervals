## Notes
The **JULIA** program is being submitted for scoring.
The PYTHON program is not.
## Files
* `merge.julia`
Julia solution
* `merge.hs`
Haskell experimentation in progress. Non functional. Do not use.
* `merge.py`
Python solution. Run with
```
python merge.py
```
and currently the input is directly in the main function in the code file.
* intervals.txt
test data, used by merge.julia at least
