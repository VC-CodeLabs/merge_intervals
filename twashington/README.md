# Merge Intervals (of Julia)
Author: T Washington
## Notes
The **JULIA** program is being submitted for scoring.
The **PYTHON** program is not.
### Julia
File: `merge.jl`
Julia solution. Run from the `twashington` directory with
```
julia merge.jl
```
OR run from within an IDE like VS-Code (run configuration exists in `.vscode\launch.json`)
Note, input can be added to the `intervals.txt` file
### Haskell
File: `merge.hs`
Haskell experimentation in progress. Non functional. Do not use.
### Python
File: `merge.py`
Python solution. Run with
```
python merge.py
```
The input is directly in the main function in the code file.
### Test data
File: `intervals.txt`
test data, used by the Julia program
