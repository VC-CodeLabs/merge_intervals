# Merge Intervals (of Julia)
T Washington
## Notes
The **JULIA** program is being submitted for scoring.
The PYTHON program is not.
## Files
* `merge.jl`
Julia solution. Run with
```
julia merge.jl
```
Note, input can be added to the `intervals.txt` file
* `merge.hs`
Haskell experimentation in progress. Non functional. Do not use.
* `merge.py`
Python solution. Run with
```
python merge.py
```
and currently the input is directly in the main function in the code file.
* intervals.txt
test data, used by the Julia program
